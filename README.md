# Energy-information-trade-off-in-neuronal-processing
This project presents a multi-scale computational analysis of how neurons balance energy consumption and information transmission, with a special focus on bursting dynamics. Using extended Hodgkin–Huxley models, we explore how different ionic mechanisms and firing patterns influence the metabolic cost of neural signaling.
